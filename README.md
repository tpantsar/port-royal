## Port Royal - A simple card game

### Project structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the `server` and the `client`.
The server is a RESTful API built with Node+TypeScript, and the client is a single-page application built with React.

`server-java` is a legacy project that was built with Java and Spring Boot. It is not used in this project.
